# Usage:
try to download the required python modules. (open a command line and use pip install -r requirements.txt)

start the program. it's just python.
load the pdf. if the programs detects images in it, they can be extracted automatically.

to render the video, you need to have ffmpeg.exe (downloadable here: https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) either in your path or next to main.py.
important: you do not need to click on ("load images") to render the video, this button is for functionality that is currently unimplemented.
